### The Impact of Community Development Corporations on Neighborhood Housing Markets.

[Smith, Brent. (2003) The Impact of Community Development Corporations on Neighborhood Housing Markets. Modeling Appreciation. URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW, Vol. 39, No. 2, November 2003 181-204](LITERATURE/Smith,B._2003_Community_development_corporations.pdf)

The paper studies the effect of housing development by nonprofit Community Development Corporations (CDCs) in the sale prices of houses. The study uses a quasi experimental design to analyze the rate of appreciation in residential property values in two different spatial units: a treatment area, serviced by a CDC and a control area, both in the Center Township in Indianapolis (Indiana). The study collects information of price index changes between 1987 and 2000 and uses a model developed to assess the influence of CDC presence on the rate of appreciation of residential real estate in Center Township in Indianapolis, Indiana. The data set includes 1,375 residential sales from 1987 and from the second quarter of 1999 through the second quarter of 2000.2 The study period is relevant as it encompasses the decade of the 1990s, a period of rapid expansion of CDC activities in Indianapolis.

Indianapolis CDCs focus on producing and rehabilitating residential properties and offering those properties as affordable housing in the form of rental and/or market-grade owner occupancy properties. Becase CDCs operate in depressed neighborhoods; they tend to be the only investor/developer serving the community.

Despite the negative factors associated with CDC zone neighborhoods, the presence and activities of CDCs enhance the return opportunities that stimulate private investment. As a result, CDC neighborhoods show a higher appreciation of sale prices when compared to those neighborhoods in the city not represented by CDCs. Initially, the groups (treatment and control), show a nearly identical appreciation during the study period (62.42% and 64.87% respectively) appreciation over the study period. However, when adjusted for the differences in starting prices (1987) between the two groups (CDC neighborhoods had a 7.79% lower price than the control group), it is concluded that the appreciation rate of the treatment area between 1987 and 2000 was higher than in the comparison area.

Although the findings from this analysis are enlightening, the authors point out that it is very difficult to imply any sort of causality inference. This happens because CDCs are but a single unit in a garrison of public and nongovernmental entities working to combat urban decay in Indianapolisâ€™s more degraded areas. Controlling for the involvement of other organizations in a parsimonious model would be a daunting proposal and would likely dilute the value of the findings. Many alternative support units (neighborhood community organizations, church groups, small-business enhancement programs, and urban enterprise zones) conduct activities outside as well as inside CDC boundaries. Implicitly, one would expect the activities of such groups to influence community well-being and property values in a similar manner whether in or outside of CDC boundaries.

Finally, two points must be made about the study: (1) there is no discussion about the cost-effectiveness of the policy; and (2) the study fails to address that CDC investment happens in specific locations within the designated area (the unit of analysis of the study). This means that the effects of the CDCs activities are not homogeneous in the spatial unit. A micro-level analysis of the effects of clustering housing investment and the influence of distance is suggested by the authors. In addition, a comparison between CDCs based on organizational characteristics would contribute to our understanding of the relationship between nonprofit capacity and performance measurement.
