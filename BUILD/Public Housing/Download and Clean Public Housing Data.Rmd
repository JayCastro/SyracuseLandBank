## Public Housing Data

To examine the effects of public housing availability on home values we will use data on the number of subsidized units available in each census tract every year between 2010 and 2015. This data was obtained from HUD (https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets/assthsg.html#2009-2016_query).

## 1. Load Data

Load data on public housing and Syracuse shapefile. Public housing data from each year is stored in its own csv. We'll first read in each csv and then will combine them and clean the data.

```{r}

#Read in 2010 data
pubhous.2010 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202010.csv", header = TRUE)

#Read in 2011 data
pubhous.2011 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202011.csv", header = TRUE)

#Read in 2012 data
pubhous.2012 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202012.csv", header = TRUE)

#Read in 2013 data
pubhous.2013 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202013.csv", header = TRUE)

#Read in 2014 data
pubhous.2014 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202014.csv", header = TRUE)

#Read in 2015 data
pubhous.2015 <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/DATA/RAW_DATA/publichousing%202015.csv", header = TRUE)

#Load in Syracuse shapefile 
syr <- geojson_read("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lecy/SyracuseLandBank/master/SHAPEFILES/SYRCensusTracts.geojson", method="local", what="sp" )

```

## 2.  Wrangle Data

Create a data set with the number of subsidized units available in each census tract from 2010-2015.

```{r}

###Add a year column into each data set

#For each data set add a column with the year the data corresponds to 
pubhous.2010.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2010 , year = "2010")

pubhous.2011.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2011 , year = "2011")

pubhous.2012.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2012 , year = "2012")

pubhous.2013.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2013 , year = "2013")

pubhous.2014.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2014 , year = "2014")

pubhous.2015.1 <- mutate( pubhous.2015 , year = "2015")

```

```{r}

###The same general steps are followed for each year: drop unnecessary columns, filter the data to include only Onondaga county, and create a new column with a numeric variable for census tract. Different years varied slightly in formatting in the original data so these steps are done for specific years before all the data is combined.


#Rename 2010 census tracts

#First drop all columns except program (which identifies it as public housing), name (county), code (census tract), units avaliable, and year
pubhous.2010.2 <- pubhous.2010.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name", "Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

#Next filter the data to include only census tracts inside Onondaga county
pubhous.2010.3 <- filter( pubhous.2010.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2010.2$Name, value = T ) )


#Rename 2011 census tracts

pubhous.2011.2 <- pubhous.2011.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name", "Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

pubhous.2011.3 <- filter( pubhous.2011.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2011.2$Name, value = T ) )


#Rename 2012 census tracts

pubhous.2012.2 <- pubhous.2012.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name","Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

pubhous.2012.3 <- filter( pubhous.2012.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2012.2$Name, value = T ) )


#Rename 2013 census tracts

pubhous.2013.2 <- pubhous.2013.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name", "Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

pubhous.2013.3 <- filter( pubhous.2013.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2013.2$Name, value = T ) )


#Rename 2014 census tracts

pubhous.2014.2 <- pubhous.2014.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name","Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

pubhous.2014.3 <- filter( pubhous.2014.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2014.2$Name, value = T ) )


#Rename 2015 census tracts

pubhous.2015.2 <- pubhous.2015.1[ , c("Program.label", "Name","Code", "Subsidized.units.available", "year") ]

pubhous.2015.3 <- filter( pubhous.2015.2 , Name %in% grep( "Onondaga", pubhous.2015.2$Name, value = T ) )



###Combine years into one data set

#Combine years 2010 to 2015
pubhous.1 <- rbind(pubhous.2010.3, pubhous.2011.3, pubhous.2012.3, pubhous.2013.3, pubhous.2014.3, pubhous.2015.3)

```


```{r}

###Drop unnecessary rows and columns

#Filter to drop all programs besides public housing
pubhous.2 <- filter(pubhous.1 , Program.label == "Public Housing")

#Filter to drop all tracts outside of Syracuse
pubhous.3 <- filter(pubhous.2 , as.numeric(Code) < 36067006200)

#Drop all rows with NA units available
pubhous.4 <- pubhous.3[!is.na(pubhous.3$Subsidized.units.available), ]

#Drop all columns except for year, tract
public.housing <- pubhous.4[ , c("year","Code", "Subsidized.units.available") ]

#Rename columns for consistancy 
colnames(public.housing)[1] <- "YEAR"

colnames(public.housing)[2] <- "TRACT"

```

## 3. Add data to GitHub

Add data frame to Processed Data folder in Github

```{r}

setwd( "../../DATA/AGGREGATED_DATA" )
write.csv( public.housing, "publichousing_aggregated.csv", row.names=F )

```

## 4. Analysis

```{r}

###Create a map of number of public housing units available by census tract in 2015

#Create a color palette to display units available on a map: red will represent high values, blue will represnt low
color.function <- colorRampPalette( c("steel blue","light gray", "firebrick4" ) )

#There will be 5 colors between blue and red to demonstrate increasing intensity
col.ramp <- color.function( 3 )

#Group number of units into 5 levels of intensity. 'color.vector' will display the code for the color of the group that each census tract now belongs to 
color.vector <- cut( rank(public.housing$Subsidized.units.available), breaks=3 , labels=col.ramp )

#Change class from factor to character
color.vector <- as.character( color.vector )

#The order of these entries has been perserved, so a simple cbind will match each row with the color code corresponds to it (based on the number of code violations in that row)
pubhous.colors <- cbind(as.data.frame(public.housing), color.vector)

#Choose a specific year
pubhous.colors.year <- filter(pubhous.colors, YEAR == "2015" )

#Merge data on fequency of code violations (that includes a color designation) with the syracuse shapefile 
syr.pubhous <- merge(syr, pubhous.colors.year, by.x="GEOID10", by.y="TRACT")

#create a color vector that matches the order of the tracts listed in this newly merged data frame
color.vector.2 <- as.character(syr.pubhous$color.vector)

#Plot the map
plot(syr.pubhous , col= color.vector.2)

#Add a title and legend to the map
title( main="Amount of Subsidied Housing Units Available 2015")

legend.text=c("low level", "medium level", "high level")

legend( "bottomright", bg="white",
        pch=19, pt.cex=1.5, cex=0.7,
        legend=legend.text, 
        col=col.ramp, 
        box.col="white",
        title="Amount of Subsidized Housing Units Available" 
)

```

```{r}
