##Information about the Dataset
The Permits Dataset has information for 21,556 permits from 2012 - 2016. 
For each permit the Dataset inclueds variables like:

* Type of Permit
* Applicant name (can be either a person or a company)
* Location
* SBL
* Date Issued
* Valuation (cost of the activity the applicant is requesting permit for)
* Fee Amount (the monies for the City)

We used the types of permits to construct 4 categories that we will aggregate as variables at the Census Tract level.

There are 32 types of permits, and we have placed this types of Permits into 4 categories to analyze them separately. They are:

* Residential Properties
* Commercial Properties
* Demolitions
* Installations and Repairs (to public space, res and com)


In what follows we explain the categories that we have constructed and show some descriptives.

###DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS

###**1. All Categories Permit Categories**

####Main takeaways:

* This dataset we have a total of 16829 observations (or permits), with a median project valuation of $3,400.  
* During the last five years, the average number of permits given per year is approx. 3,360. This number has been very stable in recent years, with a small fall during 2016.  
* Most investment projects (60.2%) have a value below $5,000, while 17.5% have a value of $20,000+.  
* Investment projects are fairly distributed across the city. Installation and Repairs are the most prevalent form of investments, followed by residential property investment project.  
* The census tracts around Downtown, Lakefront, University Hill, Strathmore, Highway 81 and Highway 690 have received most investments projects, measured in aggregate value.

####**2. Residential Property Investments**

####Main takeaways:

* This category contains permits for new 1-2 family residential projects as well as remodeling and change in occupancy projects. 
* There have been 2257 residential investment projects in the City of Syracuse over the last five years. Most of them are remodeling and change in occupancy projects (98%).
* The years 2014 and 2015 showed an important increase in the number of residential projects in, with a total of 565 and 598 projects, respectively. This figure dropped to 404 in 2016.
* Most residential investment projects (63.5%) have a value of $5,000 or below, while only 6.1% have a value of $20,000+.  
* The census tracts around the South Valley, Far-West side, Westside, Near Northeast, Eastwood, Near Eastside, Westcott, University Neighborhood, Lincoln, Salt Springs, Sedgwick and Meadowbrook neighborhoods have received most residential investments projects, measured in aggregate value.

####Main takeaways:

* This category contains permits for the construction of new commercial buildings as well as the renovation, remodeling or change in occupancy projects. 
* There have been 1716 commercial investment projects over the last five years. Most of them have been renovation, remodeling or change in occupancy projects (96.7%).

###**4. Demolitions**

####Main takeaways:

* This category contains 595 observations for demolition permits in the City of Syracuse. 
* Over the last five years, the demolition permits annual average has been 119. This number has been fairly consistent, with a small increase (164 permits) in 2015.
* The value of the demolition projects ranges from zero dollars to $300,000, with most projects (24.2%) falling between $10,000 and $20,000.
* Census tracts around Downtown, Lakefront, Westside, Near Westside, Near Eastside, Southwest, and Brighton have seen the largest number of demolition projects, measured in aggregate value.

###**5. Installations and Repairs on all properties**

####Main takeaways:

* This category is composed several kinds of permits, including: Electric, Elevator, Fire Alarm, HVAC/Mechanical, Misc.(deck, fence,ramp), Pool / Hot Tub, Security Alarm, Sprinkler, and Tank.
* There have been a total of 12,261 installations and repairs projects over the last five years. Most of them have been Electric (46.6%), HVAC/Mechanical (17.6%) and Sprinkler (14.5%) projects.
* The number of installations and repairs projects has been somewhat consistent over the last five years, with an annual average of 2,449 permits per year. However, last year, there was a small decrease in the number of installations and repairs permits with only 2,013.
* Most installations and repairs projects (67%) had a value of $5,000 or below and only and only 13.7% of projects had a value of $20,000+.
* The census tracts around Downtown, Lakefront, Westside, Near Eastside, Near Northeast, and Highway 81 have received most commercial investments projects, measured in aggregate value.
