#Introduction

Restaurants and bars play a significant role in shaping neighborhoods within a city.  In many cases these establishments can shape the environment and reputation that a neighborhood has.  A new, popular restaurant and a unruly, noisy bar can each affect its surrounding area for better or for worse.  This page analyzes data regarding the distribution of restaurants and bars around the city of Syracuse, aggregating key indicators to the census tract level.

##Overview

The page is comprised of six sections.  First, the introduction which contains an overview of the data and how to modify it.  Second, the setup required to conduct the analysis.  This includes loading the original yelp dataset and census tract shapefiles.  Third, a couple of reusable functions are defined in order to minimize the amount of code and the number of changes required for future modifications.  Fourth, the data is aggregated to the census tract level.  The focus of the analysis is on key indicators (rating, reviews, concentration of establishments) but there are numerous other indicators in the original dataset that could be explored in the future.  Fifth, a sample of the output is displayed before generating the output file. Sixth, the appendix which contains information regarding the source data.

##Future Enhancements

In order to expand upon this analysis, additional columns can be added to the aggregated output data.  This can be done by copying an existing aggregation section, prefixed with "Aggregation:" and modifying the two sections of code in the following way:

In the first code section, the original data stored in the "dat" data frame and creates a new column in teh output aggregated data frame enttitled "yelp.data".  To modify, follow these steps:

1. Change the name of the column in the yelp.data data frame from "RATING" to a new name.
2. In the aggregate.tract function change the column you want to aggregate in the source data frame entititled "dat".  
3. Conditions can be added to subset the original data frame as is done in the example below.  However, the dat$FIPS condition must match.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
yelp.data$RATING <- aggregate.tract(dat$RATING[dat$RATING > 0], dat$FIPS[dat$RATING > 0], "mean", yelp.data$TRACT, 0)
```

In this code section, the data is plotted in a map by census tract.  To modify, follow these steps:

1. In the plot.census function call, change the first argument to use the new column name that was created in the above section.
2. Optionally, modify the fifth argument (integer value) to change the number of decimals in the legend.
3. Optionally, rename the title of the plot, last argument, to a more applicable name.

```{r, warning=F, message=F, eval=F}
plot.census(yelp.data$RATING, yelp.data$TRACT, color.slice, color.ramp, 1, "Average Rating by Census Tract")
```
